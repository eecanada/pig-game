# Description 

* Pig-Game is a game where two players take turns rolling a dice until one player reaches 100 and wins. If a player rolls a one they lose their current score and it becomes the next players turn. If a player rolls two sixes in a row then their whole global score is reduced to zero and it becomes the next player's turn.
